# Developed-a-software-with-GUI-to-smooth-the-ship-hull-lines
This contains a GUI program to smooth the ship hull lines, using Matlab;

GUI to smooth.fig and GUI to smooth.m are main program that contain a MATLAB GUI to smooth the ship hull lines;

spline.m is the core algorithm to interpolate using cubic spline, it is embedded in the callback function of pushbutton5;

smooth.m is the core algorithm to smooth the ship hull lines, it is embedded in the callback function of pushbutton6;

data.txt is the test data for this program's function
